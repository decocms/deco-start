# Observability

`@decocms/start` ships a thin, opinionated observability layer for Deco storefronts on Cloudflare Workers. Spans, logs, and metrics flow through Cloudflare's managed export — there is no in-Worker OTLP exporter. The framework's job is to emit a well-shaped signal; transport is solved by Cloudflare Destinations and the `deco-otel-ingest` Worker.

| Span                              | Source                                        | Key attributes                                                         |

All framework spans also carry the per-span attribute floor described under **Identity**.

## What's measured

The meter is plugged at boot when `DECO_METRICS` (Workers Analytics Engine) is bound:

| Metric                         | Type      | Source                              | Labels                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `http_requests_total`          | counter   | `workerEntry`                       | `method`, `path`, `status`      |
| `http_request_duration_ms`     | histogram | `workerEntry`                       | `method`, `path`, `status`      |
| `http_request_errors_total`    | counter   | `workerEntry` (status >= 500)       | `method`, `path`, `status`      |
| `cache_hit_total`              | counter   | edge cache decision                 | `profile`, `decision`           |
| `cache_miss_total`             | counter   | edge cache decision                 | `profile`, `decision`           |
| `resolve_duration_ms`          | histogram | `resolveDecoPage`                   | —                               |

`decision` values mirror the `X-Cache` response header: `HIT`, `STALE-HIT`, `STALE-ERROR`, `MISS`, `BYPASS`.

## Identity stamped on every span and log

`instrumentWorker(handler, { serviceName: "my-store" })` stamps the following on every framework-created span AND every log line via the logger attribute floor:

- `service.name` — the value passed to `instrumentWorker`, or `env.DECO_SITE_NAME`, or `"deco-site"`
- `service.version` — `env.CF_VERSION_METADATA?.id` (omitted when the binding isn't present)
- `deco.runtime.version` — `@decocms/start` build-time constant
- `deployment.environment` — `env.DECO_ENV_NAME` or `"production"`
- `deco.apps.version` — optional, passed via `OtelOptions.decoAppsVersion`

In addition, every log emitted inside a `withTracing(...)` scope carries:

- `trace_id` and `span_id` — pulled from the active span's `spanContext()`

That makes it possible to jump from any log line straight to its trace in ClickStack/HyperDX.

## Required `wrangler.jsonc` shape

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-store",
  "main": "./src/worker-entry.ts",
  "compatibility_date": "2026-02-14",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat", "no_handle_cross_request_promise_resolution"],
  "observability": {
    "enabled": true,
    "logs": {
      "enabled": true,
      "invocation_logs": true,
      "head_sampling_rate": 1,
      "persist": true,
      "destinations": [
        {
          "id": "deco-otel-ingest-logs",
          "kind": "otlp_http",
          "endpoint": "https://deco-otel-ingest.deco-cx.workers.dev/v1/logs"
        }
      ]
    },
    "traces": {
      "enabled": true,
      "head_sampling_rate": 0.01,
      "persist": true,
      "destinations": [
        {
          "id": "deco-otel-ingest-traces",
          "kind": "otlp_http",
          "endpoint": "https://deco-otel-ingest.deco-cx.workers.dev/v1/traces"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "version_metadata": { "binding": "CF_VERSION_METADATA" },
  "analytics_engine_datasets": [
    { "binding": "DECO_METRICS", "dataset": "deco_metrics_my_store" }
  ]
}
```

The `version_metadata` binding is what makes `service.version` show up on spans and logs — without it, the framework still works but you can't correlate regressions to a specific deployment.

## Wiring `instrumentWorker`

```ts
// src/worker-entry.ts
import { createDecoWorkerEntry } from "@decocms/start/sdk/workerEntry";
import { instrumentWorker } from "@decocms/start/sdk/otel";
import serverEntry from "./server";

const handler = createDecoWorkerEntry(serverEntry, options);
export default instrumentWorker(handler, { serviceName: "my-store" });
```

`OtelOptions` also accepts a function `(env) => OtelOptions` if your service name comes from env.

## Log shape (and how to query it)

Cloudflare Destinations wraps every `console.log` line into an OTLP `LogRecord` with the JSON body in `body.stringValue`. The ingest Worker maps that to ClickHouse's `otel_logs.Body` verbatim. To filter logs by a structured field, use `JSONExtract` in ClickHouse:

```sql
-- Error rate by service over the last hour
SELECT
  ServiceName,
  countIf(JSONExtractString(Body, 'level') = 'error') AS errors,
  count()                                              AS total,
  errors / total                                        AS error_rate
FROM otel_logs
WHERE Timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY ServiceName
ORDER BY error_rate DESC;
```

```sql
-- All logs for a given trace
SELECT Timestamp, SeverityText, Body
FROM otel_logs
WHERE JSONExtractString(Body, 'trace_id') = '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef'
ORDER BY Timestamp ASC;
```

In the ClickStack UI you can also filter logs panel by `trace_id` directly — paste the ID from a span and the matching log lines appear.

## Outbound trace propagation

For any outbound `fetch` issued during a request (VTEX, Shopify, internal APIs), inject a W3C `traceparent` header so upstream services that participate in OTel can join your trace:

```ts
import { injectTraceContext } from "@decocms/start/sdk/observability";

async function tracedFetch(url: string, init?: RequestInit) {
  const headers = new Headers(init?.headers);
  injectTraceContext(headers);
  return fetch(url, { ...init, headers });
}
```

`injectTraceContext` is a no-op when no span is active and when the active span doesn't expose `spanContext()` — safe to call unconditionally. In `@decocms/apps`, the canonical `createInstrumentedFetch` helper calls this for every outbound call, so most sites don't have to think about it.

## Sampling

`head_sampling_rate` on `observability.traces` and `observability.logs` decides at the very start of a trace/log whether Cloudflare Destinations forwards it to the deco-otel-ingest endpoint. CF Destinations does NOT support tail sampling (status-aware filtering after the trace completes), so the framework leans on head sampling for cost control plus a separate direct-POST channel for error logs (so 100% of errors are captured regardless of the head sampling rate).

**Recommended defaults:**

- `traces.head_sampling_rate: 0.01` — 1% of traces forward via CF Destinations.
- `logs.head_sampling_rate: 1.0` — 100% of logs forward today; will drop to `0.01` once the direct-POST error channel ships (`@decocms/start/sdk/observability`'s `errorLog()` will bypass CF and emit straight to `/v1/logs` at 100%, so info/warn can safely be sampled at the boundary).

**Per-site override tier (heavy traffic only):**

- `traces.head_sampling_rate: 0.001` — 0.1% — for sites projected over 100M requests/month, with explicit team sign-off in the site repo's commit message or PR. NOT a codemod default, NOT documented as a recommended floor for all sites.

**Why 1% and not 10%:** at the fleet scale we operate (`~2.5B req/month`, 100 sites, `~20` spans/req), shipping 10% of traces through CF Destinations puts the account at meaningful risk of tripping the 5B-events/day cap (CF auto-applies forced 1% sampling for the rest of the day once you cross it, drowning out every site's signal — a single viral campaign on one storefront becomes a fleet-wide outage of telemetry). 1% gives us a 2.5x headroom and keeps annual telemetry cost in the low hundreds of dollars.

**Why no documented rate above 1%:** every value above `0.01` shipped as an "example" or "documented recommendation" is an attractive nuisance: someone copy-pastes it into a high-traffic site's `wrangler.jsonc` to "debug an incident" and forgets to revert, and the next month the team eats a five-figure CF bill. Higher rates are technically possible and may be temporarily appropriate for a specific investigation — they just shouldn't be documented as defaults anywhere. Audit rule `wrangler.head_sampling_rate_elevated` flags any value above `0.01`.

**Upgrade path for 100% error traces (NOT recommended at our scale):** ingest-side filtering. Set `head_sampling_rate: 1.0` and let `deco-otel-ingest` drop OK traces deterministically by `TraceId` while keeping all error traces. Costs ~$44K/mo at our scale (verified against current CF and DO pricing), versus ~$420/mo for the chosen path of head-sample-1% + direct-POST-errors. Lives in the ingest Worker, not the framework, and only worth it when downstream cost stops mattering.

## Cost model (fleet of 100 sites, 2.5B req/month)

Verified against Cloudflare's current public pricing (Workers requests `$0.30/M`, Workers Logs `$0.60/M` after the 20M/mo free tier, AE data points `$0.25/M` after 10M/mo, AE reads `$1.00/M` after 1M/mo) and ClickHouse Cloud storage at the projected compressed volume:

| Strategy | CF Destinations $/mo | Ingestor + CH $/mo | AE $/mo | DO $/mo | Total fleet $/mo |
|----------|---------------------:|-------------------:|--------:|--------:|-----------------:|
| **head=1% + errors via direct POST + metrics via direct POST (chosen)** | ~$360 | ~$20 | ~$39 | $0 | **~$420** |
| head=0.1% (heavy-site tier) | ~$18 | ~$20 | ~$39 | $0 | ~$70 |
| head=10% + 100% logs | ~$8.8K | ~$10 | ~$39 | $0 | ~$8.8K |
| head=100% + DO-buffered tail-on-error | ~$36K | ~$20 | ~$39 | ~$8K | ~$44K |

Numbers assume `~20` spans per request, `~4` log lines per request, and `~5` AE writes per request. The chosen-path breakdown:

- `~$360` — CF Destinations carrying 1% of traces (`~500M/mo`) and 100% of info/warn logs (`~10B/mo` — see note below) through the Workers Logs billing tier.
- `~$20` — ingestor `Worker` requests + CPU + ClickHouse Cloud writes (`~14M POSTs/mo` from CF Destinations + direct-POST flushes combined).
- `~$39` — AE writes (`~125M/mo` at the same 1% sample as traces, coupled via the trace-id hash) + AE reads (operator dashboards).
- `$0` — no Durable Objects (the tail-on-error buffer was rejected; see "Out of scope").

> The `~10B/mo` log volume is the current state (logs at `head_sampling_rate: 1`). Once the direct-POST error channel lands, logs drop to `head_sampling_rate: 0.01` for info/warn and the CF Destinations cost falls by another `~$50/mo`, with errors carried 100% through direct POST at a few dollars on the ingestor side.

## Identity & cardinality notes

- `path` labels on `http_*` metrics are normalized via `normalizePath` (dynamic IDs collapsed to `:id`, PDP slugs to `:slug/p`) to keep AE label cardinality bounded.
- `cache.profile` is one of the built-in profiles (`product`, `listing`, `search`, `static`, `cart`, `private`, `none`) plus any custom profile registered via the site's `cacheHeaders` overrides. Small, fixed set — safe as a label.
- `deco.section` carries the section component key (e.g. `site/sections/ProductShelf.tsx`). Cardinality scales with the number of sections in the catalog — typically <100, fine for ClickHouse but **not** safe as an AE metric label (use it as a span attribute only).

## Out of scope

- **In-Worker OTLP exporter.** Removed in 5.0.0. CF Destinations handles transport; the framework only emits.
- **Tail-on-error sampling.** Lives in `deco-otel-ingest` or a CF Tail Worker if/when needed.
- **Commerce-specific spans.** Per-app (VTEX, Shopify) HTTP spans live in `@decocms/apps` via `createInstrumentedFetch`.
- **PII redaction.** Handled at the ingest Worker; no per-site code required.
